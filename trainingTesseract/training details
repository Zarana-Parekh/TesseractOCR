You can use train.sh to train Tesseract with any language and different types of font styles as well as font sizes. 

Usage:
./train.sh [-l lang] [-tesspath tesseract_path] [-datapath trainingdata_path]
    -l,--lang			          language
    -tesspath               path to tesseract bin directory
    -datapath               path to training data directory
    
The training process does not require correction of box files fed to Tesseract but for improving the accuracy of the system, 
it is advisable to correct the box files generated during the training process before feeding it back.
