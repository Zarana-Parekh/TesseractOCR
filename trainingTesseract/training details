You can use train.bash to train Tesseract with any language and different types of font styles as well as font sizes. 

Usage:
./train.bash [-num num_images] [-l lang] [-f font]
  -num,--num_images	number of images
  -l,--lang             language
  -f,--font 	          font
  
The training process does not require correction of box files fed to Tesseract but for improving the accuracy of the system, 
it is advisable to correct the box files generated during the training process before feeding it back.

The naming convention of the training files should be: lang.font.exp{num}.tif where numbering of images (num) starts from 1. 
For bold fonts, use 'fontb' instead of 'font'.
